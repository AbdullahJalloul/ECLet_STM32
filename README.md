The ATECC608A and the ATAES132A secure element can turn any Arduino or IoT Board into a full fledged Hardware Wallet. The combination also addresses all challenges of machine identity and data integrity. This way it becomes easy to turn IoT devices in market places for Sensor data.

The secure element is especially built for ST-Micro's B-L475E-IOT01A-STM32L4 Discovery kit IoT node, the reference board for Amazon's AWT for IOT. It is designed to help promptly connect IoT devices to Cloud services power-efficiently and cost-effectively, ST’s new IoT development kit adds modules for Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE), sub-GHz RF, and Wi-Fi, with a dynamic NFC-tag IC with printed antenna to a high-performance, ultra-low power STM32L4 microcontroller all on the same board.
